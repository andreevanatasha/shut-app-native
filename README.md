##Shut App is a React Native app for speechless communication
Use it anytime you want to talk to someone at a distance, don't know how to pronounce something in local language (say, an address in a cab) or just don't feel like talking. It also has a [ReactJS counterpart](https://github.com/andreevanatasha/shut-app) which is live on [shutapp.today](http://shutapp.today).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
